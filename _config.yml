description: "Philip A. DuMont was an ornithologist and naturalist who spent much of his early life in Iowa. He published a monograph on Iowa birds and was hired by Jay N. 'Ding' Darling to assess potential wildlife areas in Iowa. He worked in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service from 1935 to 1972 and wrote hundreds of leaflets, bird and mammal lists, and brochures for the refuge system. This collection includes correspondence and other documents from DuMont's time in Iowa on topics including birds, avian specimen collections, and potential wildlife areas."
