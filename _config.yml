description: "Johnny (Jack) Trice was born in Hiram, Ohio, in 1902. In 1922, Trice became the first African American student athlete at Iowa State, participating in track and football. On October 8, 1923, he died due to injuries received during his first college football game against the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. Due to the persistence of students, alumni, faculty and staff, and other supporters, the Iowa State University football stadium was named Jack Trice Stadium in 1997."
