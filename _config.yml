description: "The oral histories of the Iowa State University Cyclone Football 'Varsity' Marching Band (ISUCF'V'MB) form part of the Iowa State University Cyclone Marching Band records (RS 13/17/3) in the library's Special Collections and University Archives (SCUA). The interviewees are alumni of Iowa State College/University who participated in the marching band during their time as students or former directors of the Cyclone Marching Band. Interviewees are volunteers to the project who expressed interest in participating during Homecoming 2022 and those who were identified by others participating in the project. This project utilized SCUA employees and volunteer interviewers from within the community of marching band alumni and directors to conduct interviews. The project concluded in the fall of 2024."
