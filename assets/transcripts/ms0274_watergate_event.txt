TRANSCRIPTION BEGIN

[00:00:05]
Good evening. It was almost two years ago, in June

[00:00:08]
1972, that five men broke into the Democratic

[00:00:11]
National Committee headquarters in Washington. It

[00:00:15]
turned out that they were connected with my

[00:00:17]
reelection committee and the Watergate break in

[00:00:20]
became a major issue in the campaign. The basic

[00:00:24]
question at issue today is whether the president

[00:00:27]
personally acted improperly in the Watergate

[00:00:30]
matter.

[00:00:36]
Well, when you grew up in Iowa, which I did. It

[00:00:40]
was the son of immigrants we prided ourselves in

[00:00:43]
our country, you know, we were proud of our

[00:00:45]
country, proud of our president. We may not have

[00:00:49]
agreed with everything the president said. So

[00:00:52]
that's what I grew up with. I grew up with that

[00:00:54]
names. We listened to the president's on the radio

[00:00:58]
there, not as much television. And it gave us a

[00:01:00]
sense of pride than that period where I go to

[00:01:04]
Congress. And just because I was a different party

[00:01:08]
from Nixon and I had met Nixon at the White House

[00:01:11]
when we got sworn in, it wasn't enough just

[00:01:14]
because we differed with him on policy or certain

[00:01:17]
issues to vote for the impeachment. So that's

[00:01:21]
really what I walked into when I was elected in

[00:01:25]
November. In the general election, I had to decide

[00:01:29]
what committees I wanted to be on and I decided I

[00:01:32]
did not want to be on the House Judiciary

[00:01:34]
Committee. Of course, not knowing that it would be

[00:01:39]
in the middle of history when it would have to

[00:01:42]
take up the impeachment of Richard Nixon, of

[00:01:45]
course, if anybody had the slightest inkling that

[00:01:48]
there would be an impeachment inquiry, you know, I

[00:01:50]
would never have been put on the House Judiciary

[00:01:52]
Committee. I was a brand new member. I had no

[00:01:54]
clout. And there's no way that the leadership

[00:01:57]
would have ever given me such a plum assignment.

[00:02:00]
There have been allegations, insinuations that I

[00:02:03]
knew about the planning of the Watergate break in

[00:02:06]
and that I was involved in an extensive plot to

[00:02:09]
cover it up. The House Judiciary Committee is now

[00:02:13]
investigating these charges. From our perspective

[00:02:16]
and from the committee's role, it was a

[00:02:19]
combination of putting the presidency on trial. We

[00:02:22]
had to decide whether or not under our

[00:02:24]
Constitution, this one check of the abuse of power,

[00:02:29]
whether this one check that the framers of our

[00:02:31]
Constitution laid out, which they never expected

[00:02:35]
probably to ever happen, whether that check was in

[00:02:41]
play, what we didn't realize at the same time the

[00:02:44]
presidency was on trial, the Congress was on trial

[00:02:47]
because the Congress had to make a decision which

[00:02:50]
was momentous, which affected the country. The

[00:02:53]
stakes are very high. If we wanted to have justice

[00:02:59]
done, we couldn't be seen to be.

[00:03:02]
Acting in a partisan way, so the effort was very

[00:03:07]
serious and sincere. The House Judiciary Committee

[00:03:10]
went out of its way to act and as much a

[00:03:13]
nonpartisan way as possible because we did not

[00:03:16]
want any questions to be asked about where we

[00:03:19]
being unfair to Richard Nixon. So we wanted to do

[00:03:22]
whatever we did correctly.

[00:03:30]
Ever since the existence of the White House taping

[00:03:32]
system was first made known last summer. I have

[00:03:35]
tried vigorously to guard the privacy of the tapes,

[00:03:40]
I've been well aware that my effort to protect the

[00:03:43]
confidentiality of presidential conversations has

[00:03:46]
heightened the sense of mystery about Watergate.

[00:03:49]
And in fact, this has increased suspicions of the

[00:03:53]
president. Many people assume that the tapes must

[00:03:59]
incriminate the president, otherwise he wouldn't

[00:04:03]
insist on their privacy. We had no idea that there

[00:04:06]
would be tapes that we would listen to and the

[00:04:10]
impact of those tapes, which probably no president

[00:04:15]
now is ever going to have in the White House again,

[00:04:18]
really was a crushing blow. And when I heard the

[00:04:20]
tapes and had to make that decision, that's that's

[00:04:25]
really what was a major factor in terms of

[00:04:29]
ultimately deciding the vote. No one in the White

[00:04:32]
House was involved. I want there to be no question

[00:04:37]
remaining about the fact that the president has

[00:04:40]
nothing to hide. He wasn't able to admit his

[00:04:46]
mistakes if he would have been able to have gone

[00:04:49]
before the camera and said, look, I'm sorry the

[00:04:53]
events happened that were not right. It was wrong

[00:04:57]
and I was wrong. And I I asked the American public

[00:05:02]
for forgiveness. And I still want to be your

[00:05:05]
president. I think our public is a forgiving kind

[00:05:10]
of public. And the voter would have accepted that.

[00:05:14]
And I think it would have been very difficult to

[00:05:17]
proceed. I think that argument would have been

[00:05:20]
hard. He could have acknowledged what happened and

[00:05:25]
I think it would have been taken on its face and

[00:05:28]
perhaps would have changed the ultimate outcome.

[00:05:37]
The only other emotional moment that came to me

[00:05:42]
was that I felt sad when we had the vote

[00:05:47]
was very emotional because I didn't want to

[00:05:51]
impeach the president, I didn't want to remove a

[00:05:54]
president. I didn't want to acknowledge the abuse

[00:05:57]
of office. Mr. Flowers, I. Mr. Sarbanes. I. Mr.

[00:06:04]
Railsback.

[00:06:08]
MS. Holtzman, I. Nobody took any pleasure in that

[00:06:14]
vote. I didn't agree with many of the things that

[00:06:18]
Richard Nixon stood for, but I hated having to

[00:06:22]
cast that vote because he was my president and I

[00:06:25]
did not want to see president of the United States

[00:06:28]
engage in that conduct. But I knew I had no choice.

[00:06:31]
I knew I had a responsibility under the

[00:06:33]
Constitution to hold him accountable. Mr. Cohen.

[00:06:40]
Mr. Rodino, I.

[00:06:43]
Mr. Connor, I.

[00:06:47]
Mr. Mezvinsky, I mean, we talked among ourselves,

[00:06:52]
including the Barbara Jordan and the other people

[00:06:55]
and the chairman Rodino instead, it was a sad

[00:06:58]
moment, but yet it was probably one of the finest

[00:07:02]
hours for Congress. Later, we discovered when we

[00:07:05]
voted for the impeachment of Richard Nixon, I

[00:07:09]
don't recall that any poll had been taken. So

[00:07:13]
nobody exactly knew what the consequences of this

[00:07:16]
were going to be, we just did what the evidence

[00:07:20]
and the Constitution and the law told us was the

[00:07:24]
right thing to do. And then when Nixon had to make

[00:07:29]
he made his resignation speech in the White House

[00:07:32]
and he talked about it. And I was then driving to

[00:07:35]
the Hill. This was after the hearings and

[00:07:37]
everything. I literally pulled off the road and

[00:07:40]
cried because I felt what it did to our country.

[00:07:44]
But yet, on the other hand, it was as I indicated,

[00:07:50]
Congress on trial was the test. And it probably,

[00:07:54]
as I said, came out to perhaps be one of the

[00:07:56]
finest hours.

[00:08:04]
The impeachment of a president is a remedy of last

[00:08:07]
resort. It is the most solemn act of our entire

[00:08:11]
constitutional process. The impact of such an

[00:08:14]
ordeal would be felt throughout the world, and it

[00:08:18]
does have its effect on the lives of all Americans.

[00:08:22]
For many years to come. There were many people who

[00:08:25]
said the country can withstand an impeachment,

[00:08:28]
that this would be tear the country apart, that we

[00:08:31]
could never do this. It would be terrible. But,

[00:08:34]
you know, the fact of the matter is, Americans are

[00:08:36]
pretty strong people and our country is a pretty

[00:08:40]
strong country and know the country did not

[00:08:42]
collapse in the face of the of the impeachment

[00:08:45]
effort. In fact, I think it became stronger

[00:08:48]
because Americans discovered that in the end, we

[00:08:50]
all shared the same value, or most of us

[00:08:53]
overwhelming majority, shared the values that more

[00:08:55]
important than a president, a party was the

[00:09:00]
Constitution and the rule of law, that we were a

[00:09:03]
democracy. So the president did something wrong

[00:09:05]
and this was the procedure. Then the procedure was

[00:09:07]
going to be followed. Here we are 40 years later

[00:09:10]
and no one's really seriously attacked. The

[00:09:13]
process in which under which the committee acted

[00:09:17]
or the results of the impeachment process, the

[00:09:20]
papers should be available for the public and for

[00:09:23]
researchers to sort of know what what we went

[00:09:26]
through. The history of this also maybe as a

[00:09:29]
lesson as to perhaps how government. Can run,

[00:09:34]
whether you're a partisan on one side or the other,

[00:09:38]
that there comes a time when you know the country,

[00:09:42]
you have to face issues and you have to come

[00:09:44]
together as a people to deal with with volatile

[00:09:49]
issues. Yes. That are emotional. But yet you

[00:09:53]
expect your government and your representatives to

[00:09:55]
sort of be to be able to do that, to take this

[00:09:59]
position. So it really showed that the

[00:10:02]
institutions of government can work and what the

[00:10:05]
founders really intended to do. So I hope the

[00:10:08]
papers will bring out perhaps what can be done

[00:10:12]
rather than what we're witnessing perhaps on the

[00:10:16]
front pages and on television today.
