TRANSCRIPTION BEGIN

[00:00:00]
Hello, I'm Senator Tom Harkin, and I appreciate

[00:00:03]
this opportunity to join with you, at least by

[00:00:05]
video in saluting former Congressman Ed Mezvinsky

[00:00:09]
for the gift of his official papers to the Iowa

[00:00:12]
State University Library. Now, folks of a certain

[00:00:15]
age in Ames, Iowa, remember Ed Muskie as the

[00:00:18]
golden boy and all state football player, a member

[00:00:22]
of the Ames High School State Championship,

[00:00:24]
basketball and track teams of nineteen fifty five.

[00:00:28]
But Ed went on to even bigger things. Obviously,

[00:00:31]
many of the paper's Ed is donating to Iesu pertain

[00:00:35]
to his work during his first term in Congress as

[00:00:38]
the most junior member of the House Judiciary

[00:00:40]
Committee, which, as we know, voted to impeach

[00:00:44]
President Nixon. On a personal note, I remember Ed

[00:00:48]
is a kind of role model for how to get elected to

[00:00:50]
Congress. You see, Ed ran in 1970 and failed in

[00:00:54]
his first campaign for the US House in 1970. But

[00:00:59]
he was persistent, worked hard, and then he won in

[00:01:01]
1972. And he did so by mobilizing an insurgent

[00:01:05]
student led campaign, drawing heavily from young

[00:01:08]
people at the University of Iowa. So likewise, I

[00:01:13]
failed in my first race for Congress in 1972, but

[00:01:17]
I was persistent, worked hard and won two years

[00:01:19]
later, largely thanks to an insurgent student led

[00:01:23]
campaign drawing heavily from young people at Iowa

[00:01:26]
State. Of course, Ed and I each had a Watergate

[00:01:30]
connection. As I mentioned, Ed was a member of the

[00:01:33]
committee that approved three articles of

[00:01:36]
impeachment in July of 1974, and I was a, quote,

[00:01:40]
Watergate baby, one of the fifty three Democrats

[00:01:44]
elected to Congress for the first time in November

[00:01:46]
of nineteen seventy four, largely as a result of

[00:01:50]
the Watergate scandal. Now, Ed's papers will

[00:01:54]
obviously be of great interest to historians of

[00:01:56]
the Watergate area and era and its aftermath. It's

[00:02:00]
a significant act of public service for Ed to

[00:02:02]
donate them to Iowa State. So thank you, Ed, for

[00:02:06]
your service in Congress to the people of Iowa.

[00:02:09]
And I congratulate Iowa State on this important

[00:02:11]
acquisition.
