TRANSCRIPTION BEGIN

[00:00:00]
Hi, I want to welcome the entire Mezvinsky family

[00:00:03]
to Ames, and I want to congratulate my friend and

[00:00:07]
former Congressman Ed Mezvinsky on the great honor

[00:00:11]
of having his papers being housed at Iowa State

[00:00:14]
University, which is a very, very special place to

[00:00:17]
me, my wife, Carolyn, and our family. I met my

[00:00:21]
wife and I was state and I was a student at Iowa

[00:00:24]
State when I got to vote for the first time in

[00:00:27]
nineteen seventy six. That was the first

[00:00:30]
opportunity I had to vote for a member of Congress

[00:00:34]
and the member that I voted for was Ed Mezvinsky.

[00:00:38]
Ed, as you all know, was a great athlete at Ames

[00:00:41]
High School. He played on the state championship

[00:00:44]
basketball team, ran on the state championship

[00:00:47]
track team, and I sent him a picture of him and

[00:00:51]
his nineteen fifty five Ames high basketball

[00:00:54]
uniform when short shorts were really short shorts.

[00:00:59]
But Ed, I'm very, very glad that you have this

[00:01:02]
opportunity to celebrate with your family,

[00:01:04]
particularly your great work during the period

[00:01:08]
leading up to Watergate when you served on the

[00:01:11]
House Judiciary Committee. I know that Watergate

[00:01:14]
had a profound impact on my life. It was one of

[00:01:17]
the reasons I went into journalism as a student at

[00:01:20]
Iowa State University. It's another reason that I

[00:01:24]
went to law school to make sure that I was doing

[00:01:28]
what I could to try to provide a balance and a

[00:01:32]
voice to people who needed one. You have given us

[00:01:36]
a great reason to celebrate this moment, and we

[00:01:40]
wish you all the best of luck. And thanks again

[00:01:43]
for returning these papers to Iowa State, where

[00:01:47]
they will be a big part of the legacy of the

[00:01:49]
university. And your time in Congress said

[00:01:52]
congratulations.
