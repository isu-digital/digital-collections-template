TRANSCRIPTION BEGIN

[00:00:02]
Greetings from Washington, D.C. I'm Congressman

[00:00:07]
John Conyers, and I thank you all for the

[00:00:11]
invitation to offer my reflections for this

[00:00:15]
retrospective on the Watergate scandal. As

[00:00:19]
Congressman Ed Mierzwinski papers, a dear friend

[00:00:24]
of mine when he was on Judiciary Committee are

[00:00:27]
donated to Iowa State University. I had the

[00:00:32]
pleasure of serving on the House Judiciary

[00:00:35]
Committee with my former colleague, Mr. Mezvinsky,

[00:00:39]
in the 1970s. And I can think of no more no place

[00:00:45]
more deserving than Iowa State to receive his

[00:00:50]
congressional papers on this, the fortieth

[00:00:54]
anniversary of Watergate. Now, since I first

[00:00:58]
arrived in Congress, I have seen nine presidents

[00:01:01]
occupy the White House. But it's important to

[00:01:05]
distinguish between political disagreements, of

[00:01:10]
which there are many and true abuses of power.

[00:01:15]
That line was clearly crossed in the consideration

[00:01:20]
of the impeachment of former President Richard

[00:01:23]
Nixon. The allegations against President Nixon's

[00:01:28]
were numerous and serious from the outset, the

[00:01:33]
House Judiciary Committee conducted its

[00:01:36]
investigation of these claims. I must say, in a

[00:01:40]
meticulous and bipartisan fashion, we hired

[00:01:45]
experts, conducted months of research, held more

[00:01:50]
than 57 public hearings on the topic. And piece by

[00:01:56]
piece and working with our Senate colleagues, we

[00:02:01]
built a pretty substantial case. The committee did

[00:02:05]
not act on impeachment until we were certain that

[00:02:08]
we had the evidence to substantiate the

[00:02:13]
allegations that would have to be brought.

[00:02:17]
That painstaking approach paid dividends. The

[00:02:23]
committee worked diligently to uncover the facts

[00:02:26]
of the Watergate break in and other abuses. Our

[00:02:31]
emphasis on the facts earned credibility with the

[00:02:34]
public, the media and even some of the Republicans

[00:02:40]
in the House. In the end, it was the Republican

[00:02:44]
leadership itself that in 1974 went to President

[00:02:51]
Nixon and convinced him to resign. We worked hard

[00:02:55]
to build consensus around the need to rein in the

[00:03:01]
executive branch.

[00:03:04]
In the years following President Nixon's

[00:03:06]
resignation, Congress began to rehabilitate the

[00:03:10]
federal government and restore the public's trust

[00:03:14]
in our elected officials and some of our key

[00:03:18]
reforms, including included the creation of the

[00:03:25]
Office of Independent Special Counsel for Future

[00:03:29]
Investigative Work, reform of campaign finance

[00:03:35]
laws to limit the corrosive influence of money in

[00:03:40]
politics, of which there's still far too much. By

[00:03:45]
amending the federal Election Campaign Act to

[00:03:48]
offer public financing for presidential elections

[00:03:52]
and to create for the first time the Federal

[00:03:56]
Election Commission to oversee and increase

[00:03:59]
transparency in elections,

[00:04:03]
convening the commission led by Senator Church

[00:04:07]
Frank Church of Idaho, which uncovered

[00:04:10]
longstanding wiretap abuses and led to new laws to

[00:04:16]
protect the privacy of American citizens,

[00:04:19]
including the creation of the Foreign Intelligence

[00:04:23]
Surveillance Court. In both the halls of Congress

[00:04:29]
and the press rooms in the Beltway and beyond,

[00:04:33]
accountability and oversight became the hallmarks

[00:04:38]
of the post Watergate era. Yet I fear that the

[00:04:42]
lessons we learned in the aftermath of Watergate

[00:04:46]
are still being. Slowly forgotten, and the reforms

[00:04:54]
that we enacted are somehow quietly eroded,

[00:05:00]
eroding. Campaign finance laws are in tatters

[00:05:05]
following a series of disastrous court decisions,

[00:05:10]
most recently with the Supreme Court in Citizens

[00:05:14]
United. Holding that the First Amendment prohibits

[00:05:19]
the government from restricting political and

[00:05:22]
expenditures by corporations and following this

[00:05:27]
decision, an activist Supreme Court decided in

[00:05:32]
Shelby County vs. Holder to turn the clock back on

[00:05:38]
civil rights by invalidating the heart of the

[00:05:42]
Voting Rights Act.

[00:05:46]
The law allowing for independent special counsel

[00:05:48]
has lapsed and has yet not been renewed, and over

[00:05:54]
time, the National Security Agency has continued

[00:06:00]
to expand its authority without proper

[00:06:04]
congressional oversight. As public revelations

[00:06:09]
have recently brought to light about the National

[00:06:13]
Security Agency's bulk collection of every phone

[00:06:19]
number and call made by everyone in the United

[00:06:24]
States. We became comfortable in the decades

[00:06:29]
following Watergate, but we can still act on the

[00:06:33]
lessons learned from that tumultuous time with a

[00:06:37]
renewed sense of purpose. I believe Congress can

[00:06:42]
again work to shore up the shortcomings in our

[00:06:46]
democracy. We would be wise to remember that our

[00:06:50]
democracy is stronger for having confronted true

[00:06:56]
abuses of power when we found them, and we must

[00:06:59]
continue to be reminded of the important lessons

[00:07:03]
learned from the Watergate era.
