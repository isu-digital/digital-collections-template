## About the collection

Walter M. Rosene Sr. was born in Ogden, Iowa, in 1880. An avid birder, he helped found the Iowa Ornithologists' Union and served as its first president from 1923 to 1926. This collection includes lantern slides (many of them hand-colored), photographs, field notes, checklists, and other documents related to Rosene's ornithological work.
