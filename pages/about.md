## About the collection

Frederic Leopold (1895-1989), the brother of wildlife ecologist Aldo Leopold, was active in conservation efforts and wildlife ecology in Iowa. Concerned about the possible extinction of the wood duck, he designed houses for wood ducks and conducted extensive studies on their mating and nesting habits. This collection contains correspondence, photographs, wood duck studies, notes, and other materials documenting his ecological work.
