## About the collection

Iowa State University Library Special Collections and University Archives preserves records that document the history of the university. It also collects materials created by members of the Cyclones community. This collection represents a selection of these materials, including books and reports about campus history and planning, as well as publications by university departments, notably the early-20th-century Home Economics Bulletin.
