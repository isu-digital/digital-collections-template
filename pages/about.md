## About Iowa Farmstead Picture Collection

State atlases and other publications from the late 19th and early 20th centuries included illustrations of Iowa farms. This collection contains engravings and lithographs (some hand-colored) depicting farmsteads and stock farms in several Iowa counties circa 1871-1904.
