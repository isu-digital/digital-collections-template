## About the collection
Sarah Tefft married Horace Underwood on November 30, 1851 in Kingston, Rhode Island. Within a few years, the couple would move to eastern Iowa, near the town of Princeton. The pair had a daughter, Mary Lilian in 1859. In the early 1860s, they returned to Rhode Island. This collection includes letters detailing Sarah's life in Iowa, asking after family and friends in Rhode Island, pressed flowers, a photograph, and a mourning shroud sample.
