## About the collection
What is now called the Iowa State University Cyclone Football 'Varsity' Marching Band (ISUCF'V'MB) was founded in 1881. For many Iowa State alumni, it has served as an integral part of student life at Iowa State for over a century. The main goal of this project was to gather the shared and varied experiences of band members throughout time, especially how societal change and campus culture impacted those experiences. These stories, stretching back decades, document a unique aspect of student life on Iowa Stateâ€™s campus. They also deepen the documented history of the marching band at Iowa State, joining the Iowa State University Cyclone Marching Band records (RS 13/17/3) of manuscripts, photographs, uniforms, etc., in Special Collections and University Archives (SCUA). The interviewees are alumni of Iowa State College/University who participated in the marching band during their time as students or former directors of the Cyclone Marching Band. The range of interviewees contributes to a diverse range of perspectives regarding the long history of the band. Interviewees are volunteers to the project who expressed interest in participating during Homecoming 2022 and those who were identified by others participating in the project. This project utilized SCUA employees and volunteer interviewers from within the community of marching band alumni and directors to conduct interviews. The project concluded in the fall of 2024.
