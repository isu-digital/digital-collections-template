## About the collection

Oral history interviews of faculty from the Iowa State University Department of Chemistry. Current and retired faculty members were interviewed by two individuals: Michael Qiu, a senior in chemistry enrolled in the Honors Program, and Patricia Thiel, Distinguished Professor of Chemistry. Qiu conducted his interviews as a component of his senior honors project. The Chemistry Department faculty members that were interviewed discuss a variety of topics associated with their careers. They tell about the path that led them to Iowa State, the changes in teaching technology during their career, and the research they were associated with.
