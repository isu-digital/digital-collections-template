## About the Collection

John Vincent Atanasoff (1903-1995) began developing concepts for an electronic computing machine in 1937 while a faculty member at Iowa State College (Iowa State University). It was shortly thereafter that he, along with graduate student Clifford Berry, started work on the world's first electronic digital computer. The computer would later be named the Atanasoff-Berry Computer (ABC).

This digital collection contains images and documents related to John Vincent Atanasoff, Clifford Berry, the Atanasoff-Berry Computer (ABC), and the court case that established the ABC as the first electronic digital computer. These materials include photographs and drawings of the original ABC, two manuscripts written by Atanasoff regarding the computer's design and functionality, a manual for it written by Berry, and Berry's master's thesis about the computer. The collection also contains documents pertaining to the court case of Honeywell, Inc. v. Sperry-Rand, specifically the decision and Atanasoff's deposition.
