## About the collection
From its founding, Iowa State allowed women to enroll. However, for much of the university's history, women endured more restrictive policies than their more numerous male counterparts and faced other forms of bias. This collection documents some of the experiences of women at Iowa State between 1960 and 1979, including campus policies and culture, activism, and a discrimination lawsuit filed against the university by the National Organization of Women.
