## About the collection

Lawrence H. Skromme had a long and productive career in the agricultural implement manufacturing industry. After earning a B.S. (1937) in agricultural engineering from Iowa State College (University), he worked at Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co. (1937-1941), designed plows and implements for Ford-Ferguson tractors (1941-1951), and served as chief engineer (1951-1961) and vice president of engineering (1961-1978) at Sperry-New Holland. His agricultural machinery literature collection comprises catalogs, advertisement cards, and other materials published by dozens of implement manufacturing companies in the last half of the 19th century and the early part of the 20th century.
