## About the Curtiss-Wright Engineering Cadettes Oral Histories

Mary Jean Logan Sweet participated in the Curtiss-Wright Engineering Cadette Program at Iowa State College (University) in 1943. Sponsored by the Curtiss-Wright Corporation, this nationwide program was designed to ease wartime labor shortages by training women to work as engineers. This collection includes oral histories with Sweet and another participant in the program, Betty Ellen Claybourn Goettsch.
