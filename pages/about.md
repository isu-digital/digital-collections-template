## About the collection

Established in 1968 as the Ames Audubon Society, the Big Bluestem Audubon Society adopted its current name in 1982, when it became an official chapter of the National Audubon Society. The society promotes the enjoyment and study of birds, other wildlife, and plants and engages in educational activities related to the conservation of the natural environment. The collection comprises newsletters, fliers and brochures, correspondence, and other records of the society.
