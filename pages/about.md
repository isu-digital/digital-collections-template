## About the Warren H. Manning Collection

Warren H. Manning was a landscape architect in Massachusetts in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He received his training at the firm of the foremost landscape architect of the era, Frederick Law Olmsted of Brookline, Massachusetts. Manning was a founder of the American Society of Landscape Architects and played a pivotal role in the development of American landscape architecture.

He developed an environmental planning model based on the concept of gathering and organizing discrete types of environmental data, such as soils and vegetative cover, in mapped form. This evolved into Manning's National Plan, a document representing an early attempt at providing a statistical profile of the entire country and a land classification system that could be used by the government to control the exploitation of natural resources and to evaluate scenic beauty.

The Warren H. Manning Collection digital collection includes many black and white lantern slides along with a few color slides that have been scanned to preserve their fragile images. Nearly 1,700 images of botanical specimens, landscape drawings, maps, and examples of gardens, cityscapes, and natural landscapes are represented along with a copy of his National Plan.

The Warren H. Manning Papers, 1882-2007, n.d.contains material related to Manning's work on the National Plan, speeches, articles, reports, client lists, drawings and plans from more than fifty of Manning's projects, glass lantern slides, and photographs.
