## About Iowa County Histories Collection

The histories of Iowa's 99 counties contribute to the broader understanding of local, state, and national history. This collection includes digitized versions of published county histories from the 19th century as well as histories compiled in the 1940s by the Iowa Writers' Program of the Work Projects Administration (formerly the Works Progress Administration).
