## About the collection

The American Statistical Association is a professional society interested in the theory, methodology, and application of statistics to all fields of human endeavor. Founded as a regional group in Boston in 1839, the ASA eventually became a large national organization and the publisher of several statistical journals. The collection comprises records, correspondence, and reports of the association, including its founding documents.
