## About the September 29th Movement Collection

The September 29th Movement was a student-led movement at Iowa State University from 1996 to 1998. The movement was dedicated to the elimination of racism, xenophobia, sexism, homophobia, and classism at Iowa State University, recognizing that changing the name of Catt Hall, a symbol of exclusion, must be the first step in that struggle. This collection contains a variety of documents that cover topics such as the life of Carrie Chapman Catt, the university's building naming practices, the women's suffrage movement, and the relationship between white women's suffrage and African-American civil rights.
