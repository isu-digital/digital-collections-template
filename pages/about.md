## About the collection

The National Farmers Organization (NFO) formed in 1955 in response to the rapidly decreasing prices of agricultural products. This grassroots organization, based in Corning, Iowa, soon became a national political movement. The NFO produced the films in this collection during the 1960s as a way to communicate with membership and to educate rural communities on holding actions, collective bargaining, and other NFO activities and policies. Speakers, including members of the NFO leadership team, U.S. Senators, state politicians, religious leaders, businessmen, member farmers, and farm wives, discuss a variety of topics, such as farm production, corporate farming, federal agricultural policies, trade, and marketing.

These films were digitized and preserved in part by support from a Recordings at Risk grant from the Council on Library and Information Resources (CLIR). The grant program is made possible by funding from The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.
