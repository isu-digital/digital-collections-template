## About the Collection
Charles Christopher Parry, botanist and physician, lived in Davenport, Iowa. In 1849 he was appointed botanist to the United States-Mexican boundary survey and worked in this capacity for three years. For the rest of his life, Parry spent his summers in botanical expeditions in the western United States.
