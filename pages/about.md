## About the collection
Football has been played at Iowa State University (formal known as the Iowa State Agricultural College) since the 1870s, initially on an intramural level. Iowa State University held its first organized football game against State Center in 1892, under coach and team captain Ira Brownlie. In 1894, the team became part of an officially organized athletic association and competed with other colleges in the state of Iowa. The first football program in the digital collection is from 1896 game played against the University of Minnesota.

Football programs document a significant part of Iowa State Universityâ€™s athletics history. These materials highlight the players and status of the various teams. In addition, Football programs provide a glimpse of campus and local history through articles relating to the universities playing.

The digital collection contains at least one football program from each year (1896-2008). Only portions of the entire collection have been digitized. The football programs selected for the digital collection often focus on special event games such Parent Day, Homecoming, bowl games, etc. The complete collection, RS 24/6/0/5, is available in the Special Collection and University Archives Department, located in Parks Library.
