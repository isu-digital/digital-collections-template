## About the collection

Cookbooks published by Iowan communities, organizations, and individuals document the culinary heritage of Iowa and the United States. They contain not only recipes but also valuable cultural and historical information. These digitized versions of 19th- and 20th-century cookbooks represent a selection of rare books held by ISU Library's Special Collections department in its Iowa Cookbook Collection.
