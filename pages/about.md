## About the collection

Woodward H. Brown (1917-1980) was an active member of the Iowa Ornithologists' Union and the Des Moines Audubon Society. He published several articles on birds, including "An Annotated List of the Birds of Iowa." This collection includes observational data collected by Brown, correspondence with other birders, and various editions of the Des Moines Audubon Society's Polk County Check-list, compiled by Brown.
