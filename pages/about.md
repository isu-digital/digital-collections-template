## About the collection
Heywood was an entomologist and author from Cherokee, Iowa. The digital collection contains biographical information, college papers, course notes, photographs, specimen drawings, correspondence, reports, articles, book reports, scientific correspondence and articles, and glass specimen slides. Items for the digital collection were selected as representative of Heywood's development as a scientific illustrator and her education in science, her relationships with other scientists (both men and women), her civic engagement, and her contributions to entomology. The complete collection is available at the Iowa State University Library Special Collections and University Archives.
