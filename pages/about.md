## About the collection

The Iowa Agricultural College/Iowa State University yearbook, Bomb (1893-1994), was published annually for the graduating classes of 1894 through 1994, with the exception of 1902. The digital collection includes the entire run of yearbooks, along with the Centennial Album.

Up until 1925, the Bomb was published by members of the junior class and called by their year of graduation â€“ one year after the printing date. During the 1924-1925 school year, the yearbook staff was opened to students in all classes, and was called by the year it was printed. Consequently, there are two Bomb yearbooks for 1925.

The Bombs and their contents are presented as part of the historical record of Iowa State University. They should be viewed and considered within the context of the relevant time period.
