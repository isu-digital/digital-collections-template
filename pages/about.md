## About the collection

Throughout the twentieth century, farmers and farm laborers in Iowa and the Midwest advocated for fair prices and fair treatment through farmers' organizations, including the National Farmers Organization, Iowa Farmers Union, and Iowa Farm Bureau Federation. Many joined protest actions such as obstructing tuberculosis testing during the Iowa Cow War (1931), striking during the Farmers' Holiday movement (1932-1933), and dumping milk (1960s). The collection consists of administrative records, photographs, correspondence, brochures, and other materials pertaining to these pro-farm organizations and actions.
