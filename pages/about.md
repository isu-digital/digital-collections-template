## About Iowa State University Extension and Outreach Collection

The ISU Extension and Outreach predates the national Extension movement. In 1903, Sioux County farmers and Iowa State University (then called the Iowa State College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts) cooperated on seed corn improvement, thereby establishing the “extension idea” that would later be enacted nationwide through the Smith-Lever Act of 1914.The Smith-Lever Act created a nationwide system of cooperative extension services that provided outreach activities through land-grant universities. The Department of Extension was founded eight years prior to the passage of the Act with funding from the Iowa General Assembly. Perry G. Holden served as its first superintendent.

Iowa State Extension Service carries its land-grant mission beyond campus, providing a research-based educational service to the people of Iowa. Early extension work included educational trains, short courses, farmers' institutes, demonstration farms, and other activities. The state has experienced significant agricultural progress since its establishment.
