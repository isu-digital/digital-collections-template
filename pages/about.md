## About the collection

After the Stonewall riots in New York City in 1969, gay rights activists became increasingly vocal in the United States. At Iowa State, students identifying as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer joined the fight for equal rights. This student project was originally titled as "LGBT+ Student Life at Iowa State University: 1970-1999" and curated by an ISU student. The collection includes clippings of newspaper articles, fliers, and newsletters that document LGBTQ+ students' activism and the backlash they faced in the last three decades of the 20th century.
