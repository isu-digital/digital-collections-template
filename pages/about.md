## About the collection

Statistics was first taught at Iowa State by George W. Snedecor in 1914. In 1927 the college established the Mathematical Statistics Service, which became the Statistical Laboratory in 1933. The Department of Statistics was organized in 1947. This single-item collection includes a brief history of the Department of Statistics and the Statistical Laboratory from 1914 to 1950.
