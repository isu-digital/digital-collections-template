## About the collection

The National Farmers Organization (NFO) was founded in 1955 to combat low prices farmers received from food processors. Originally headquartered in Corning, Iowa, the NFO now has headquarters in Ames, Iowa. The collection includes films on various farming topics with an emphasis on political and economic issues.
