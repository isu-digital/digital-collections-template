## About Iowa State University Extension and Outreach Collection

Iowa State Extension Service carries its land-grant mission beyond campus, providing a research-based educational service to the people of Iowa. Early extension work included educational trains, short courses, farmers' institutes, demonstration farms, and other activities. The state has experienced significant agricultural progress since its establishment.
