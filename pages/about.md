## About the Collection

The history of Pammel Court is a story of community and place. Originally founded after World War II to provide temporary housing for returning veterans and their families, Pammel Court's collection of surplus metal units and narrow streets became a significant part of the Iowa State landscape for over fifty years. During its existence, Pammel Court was known by many names, including "boomtown," "the silver city," "fertile acres," "the city within a city," and even the "slums" of Iowa State. Few places on campus have evoked such strong feelings and memories. From 1946 to 1978, Pammel Court was reserved for married students and their children. This collection contains materials about the creation of a housing development, the building of a community, and the lasting memories of place.
