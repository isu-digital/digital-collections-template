## About the Collection
Charles Christopher Parry, botanist and physician, lived in Davenport, Iowa. Recognizing that botanical studies were his main interest, Parry switched to a career as a botanist the year after starting his medical practice. In 1849 he was appointed botanist to the United States-Mexican boundary survey and worked in this capacity for three years. He was the first person to hold the position of Botanist of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. For the rest of his life, Parry spent his summers in botanical expeditions in the western United States. He was best know for his work as a botanist on a number of geographic surveys in the West and Midwest parts of the United States as well as the United States and Mexican Border Survey.
