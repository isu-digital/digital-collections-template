## About the collection

After the Stonewall riots in New York City in 1969, gay rights activists became increasingly vocal across the United States. At Iowa State, students who identified as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer joined the fight for equal rights, making their voices heard on campus. This collection is based on the online exhibit, "LGBT+ Student Life at Iowa State University: 1970-1999", originally curated by ISU student Luis Gonzalez-Diaz. It includes clippings of newspaper articles, fliers, and newsletters that document LGBTQ+ students' activism and the backlash they faced throughout the last three decades of the 20th century.
