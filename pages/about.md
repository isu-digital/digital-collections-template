## About the Mary A. Barton Fashion Illustration Collection

The collection (1776-2003) contains plates of general fashion dating back to the 18th century and continuing into the 21st century. Additional categories within the files include accessories, baby and beach fashions, bridal fashions and portraits, children's and Communion clothing, footwear, inaugural gowns, maid uniforms, masquerade costumes, men's fashion, millinery, negligees and undergarments, and mourning dresses. There are also magazine issues relating to fashion as well as magazine articles discussing fashion of the Ancient, Medieval, Renaissance, and Modern periods. The digital collection is based on the collection of Mary Barton (1917-2003), an alumna (Class of 1942) from Ames, who was a quilt historian.
