## About the collection

The first building of the Iowa Agricultural College and Model Farm was completed in 1861. Renamed Iowa State College of Agricultural and Mechanic Arts in 1898 and Iowa State University of Science and Technology in 1959, the institution now covers more than 1,800 acres. This collection comprises maps of the campus and surrounding areas in the 19th and 20th centuries.
