## About this collection

Sew Easy is a series of televised dressmaking demonstrations hosted by Lucille E. Rea, a specialist in clothing and textiles with the Iowa State College Extension Service. The demonstrations were originally recorded on 16mm film, likely broadcast by WOI-TV in the 1950s, and digitized in 2022.
