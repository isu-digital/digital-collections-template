The next stop is Heliopolis, a suburb and sporting resort of Cairo. By camels they visit the pyramids of Gizeh (Giza) and stop to rest in the desert near the Sphinx. Returning to Cairo they view the city from the heights of the Citadel, watch the English ""Tommies"" (soldiers) who are standing guard, and examine Moorish architectural details. Traveling back out into the Sahara where it is 120 degrees, they view the site of the Metropolitan Museum's recent excavations, the Great Step Pyramid, and the site of the tomb of Perneb. Back to Heliopolis, the group sees the Heliopolis Palace Hotel, modern apartments, the grandstand and Sultan's Royal Box, and the Indian Palace.
